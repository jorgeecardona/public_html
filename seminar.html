	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>We will discuss Metric Analysis, a general approach for the study of functional dependencies based on the information of functional values on a finite number of fixed arguments. Effective schemes of interpolation and restoring (smoothing) for functions of one or many variables, as well as forecasting of functional values for functions of one variable, are developed based on Metric Analysis. Applications of these methods and schemes will be given; in particular, their application to restoring energy fields in nuclear reactors.</p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>In graph theory,K&ouml;nig's Lemma states that any tree with countably many vertices in which every vertex has finite degree must contain an infinite path. The proof of this result is simple, and leads to the natural question of whether analogous results hold for trees with larger sets of vertices.</p>
	      <p>In the 1930s, Aronszajn proved that the analogous result does *not* hold for trees whose vertex set has the cardinality of the continuum by constructing an object that we now call an Aronszajn Tree.</p>
	      <p>In this talk, we will discuss some basic set-theoretic notions such as cardinal and ordinal numbers, and use them to construct an Aronszajn Tree by transfinite induction.</p>

	      <p>In this talk, we'll discuss the interaction between diffusion process and differential equations via stochastic calculus. I'll start with basic notions such as martingale, Brownian motion and stochastic differential equations, etc. Then we'll see how classic PDE's are solved via Ito formula. At the end, both as a reason and a consequence of the theory developed, an example of some practical significance will be studied.</p>

	      <p>'Set' is a card game based on pattern recognition.  Interestingly, its rules can be encoded in the linear algebra of a four-dimensional affine space over the finite field with three elements. We will prove a geometric fact about this finite space- the largest a subset can be that avoids all lines is twenty- and use this to conclude a non-trivial fact about the game.</p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>A proper coloring of a graph is a map that assigns a color to each vertex with the condition that vertices connected by an edge are assigned different colors.  Given a nonnegative integer k, the chromatic polynomial counts the number of proper colorings of a graph that use at most k colors.  Stanley introduces the chromatic symmetric function of a graph, which generalizes the chromatic polynomial of a graph.  Shareshian and Wachs generalize this further to the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph.  We will look at some examples to get a better idea of what these objects are.  We will also look at a few theorems and conjectures about the chromatic symmetric function and their generalizations to the chromatic quasisymmetric function.  We will then see how these theorems apply to our examples.</p>

	    <div class="panel-heading"><strong>"On the topology of black holes and beyond", Dr. Greg Galloway</strong></div>
	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p> In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in black holes in higher dimensional gravity.  This, in particular, has led to questions about the topology of black holes in higher dimensions. In this talk we review Hawking's classical theorem on the topology of black holes in 3+1 dimensions (and its connection to black hole uniqueness) and present a generalization of it to higher dimensions.  The latter is a geometric result which places restrictions on the topology of black holes in higher dimensions.  We shall also discuss recent work on the topology of space exterior to a black hole.  This is closely connected to the Principle of Topological Censorship, which roughly asserts that the topology of the region outside of all black holes (and white holes) should be simple.   All of the results to be discussed rely on recently developments in the theory of marginally outer trapped surfaces, which are natural spacetime analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry.   The first part of the talk will be dedicated to a gentle introduction to general relativity and black holes.</p>
