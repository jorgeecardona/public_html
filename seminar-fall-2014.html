	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>The Hodge numbers of a compact complex manifold are analytic invariants similar to the topologically invariant Betti numbers of a compact differentiable manifold. The Hodge numbers can be arranged into Hodge "Hodge Diamond" for the manifold and we will look at some of its symmetries. Furthermore, if the manifold is Kahler, we will see that these numbers can be viewed as a refinement of the Betti numbers of the underlying differentiable manifold. </p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>A finite graph may be viewed as a combinatorial analogue of a one-dimensional algebraic variety. This analogy can be extended to higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. We give one example of this higher-dimensional analogy by defining a combinatorial invariant called the tropical Picard group of a simplicial complex. We then prove some basic results about the tropical Picard group for a particular class of simplicial complexes.</p>

	      <p>We will discuss first time homogeneous Markov chains on a finite state space and the existence of invariant distributions given an ergodic transition matrix and we will connect this result with the Perron-Frobenius theorem. We will then move to the general case of a Markov Chain and discuss briefly the Doeblin and Strong Doeblin conditions to get an invariant measure and a representation of the state space on ergodic components and a transient set.</p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>Gauge Theory has played an important role in the development of physics over the last century. The goal of this talk will be to provide an idea of what gauge theory is and why it is so important. We will mainly focus on its mathematical aspects while also discussing some of its applications in physics.</p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>Ehrhart theory gives a discrete analogy of volume by counting the number of integer points inside a polytope. The Ehrhart polynomial of a polytope gives the number of integer points inside dilations of the polytope.  During this talk, I will introduce some of the basic concepts of Ehrhart theory and Ehrhart polynomials.  I will work out a few examples in order for us to get a feel for the material, and I will also mention Pick's theorem, Stanley's nonnegativity theorem, and the Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity theorem.</p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>We'll discuss what self-organized criticality means with some real-world examples. To add mathematical flavor, we'll discuss a simple model of self-organized criticality, namely, the Bak-Sneppen model. Simple as this model may look, it is very difficult to prove rigorously results on its long-time behavior. Then we'll discuss some modified models and probable ideas and methods to analyze these models.</p>

	    <div class="panel-heading"><strong >"Some concepts in General Relativity", Armando Cabrera</strong></div>
	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>In 1905 Albert Einstein proposed the theory that we call now Special Relativity. Although these new ideas described the consequences of the speed of light being constant, it did not include a gravitational theory. In 1916, Einstein proposed that the matter in the universe and its geometry are closely related. In this talk, we will describe the general idea of how this relation works and what type of mathematical objects are used in this field. As an example of the type of concepts/theorems in mathematical relativity, we will talk about the notion of total mass of a spacetime (ADM mass). Finally, we will obtain the total mass of the Schwazschild solution, which describes the gravitational field outside a spherical non-rotating massive body (a star or black hole).</p>

	    <div class="panel-body">
	      <p>The symmetric group Sn with its cycle notation and the idea of a Cayley graph will be discussed in the beginning. After that we will show two different generating sets for Sn. Based on this, we will define two important orders: weak order and absolute order. In the second half of the talk, we will introduce the idea of noncrossing partitions and prove a very important bijection between the maximal interval in absolute order of Sn and the noncrossing partition of n.</p>
